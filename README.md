# friendZone: A full stack message application

* friendZone is a simple to use basic social-media-style message app that can be easily modified to add extra features or adapted to fit into other applications.

* The app uses a secure login system with the ability to stay logged in for a predetermined length of time

* The design uses the [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework to produce a clean responsive interface.
